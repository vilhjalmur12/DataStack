# Project Summary: Open-Source Big Data Stack

## **Overview**
This project is an **open-source, modular big data stack** designed for **scalable data storage, processing, querying, and visualization**. It supports **both local development (Docker Compose)** and **production deployments (Kubernetes via Helm)**, enabling efficient data management and analytics across large-scale distributed systems.

## **Purpose & Goals**
- Provide a **flexible, end-to-end big data architecture** that can handle structured and unstructured data.
- Enable **real-time and batch processing** for analytical and operational workloads.
- Support **distributed querying and federated data access** across multiple storage systems.
- Facilitate **ETL workflows, monitoring, and logging** to ensure system reliability.
- Use **100% open-source tools**, ensuring cost-effectiveness and extensibility.

## **How the Idea Was Formed**
This project was conceived to bridge the gap between **development and production environments** in big data infrastructure. Many big data solutions are difficult to test and deploy due to their complexity. Our approach provides:
- **A simple Docker Compose setup** for local development, allowing easy testing and debugging.
- **Helm charts for Kubernetes**, enabling **scalable, production-grade deployments**.
- **A structured repository** to manage services modularly.

## **Architecture & Component Layers**
The stack is built from the ground up, starting from data storage and progressing to querying, orchestration, and monitoring.

### **1️⃣ Core Data Storage Layer** (Foundational Databases)
- **MySQL & PostgreSQL** – Relational databases for metadata and transactional workloads.
- **Delta Lake** – ACID-compliant data lake for large-scale storage and analytics.

### **2️⃣ Data Warehousing & Real-Time Storage**
- **ClickHouse** – Columnar database optimized for high-speed OLAP analytics.
- **Apache Druid** – Hybrid real-time and historical OLAP storage for event data.

### **3️⃣ Data Ingestion & ETL Layer**
- **Apache NiFi** – Real-time and batch data ingestion tool with easy-to-use flows.
- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow orchestration for ETL, data pipelines, and scheduling.

### **4️⃣ Query Engine & Distributed Processing**
- **Presto & Trino** – High-performance SQL query engines for federated querying across multiple data sources.

### **5️⃣ Monitoring & Logging Layer**
- **Prometheus** – Time-series monitoring and alerting.
- **Grafana** – Visualization tool for real-time dashboards and analytics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – Centralized logging, indexing, and searching.

```

- **Docker Compose Setup (`services/` Directory)**
  - Each service has its **own Docker Compose file** for isolated testing and local deployments.
  - The **root `docker-compose.yml`** references all services for full-stack deployment.
  - `.env` files allow easy configuration of storage paths and logging.

- **Kubernetes & Helm Charts (`helm-charts/` Directory)**
  - Each service has its **own Helm chart** (`Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates/`), making it configurable and scalable.
  - `helmfile.yaml` allows **multi-service deployment** in Kubernetes.
  - `k8s-manifests/` provides raw YAML files for manual Kubernetes deployment.

## **Deployment Strategy**
- **Development:** Uses **Docker Compose** for local setups.
- **Production:** Uses **Helm Charts** for Kubernetes-based scalable deployments.
- **Environment Variables:** Configuration is managed via `.env` files for flexibility.

## **Use Cases**
- **Enterprise Data Warehousing:** Scalable storage and fast querying.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Process streaming and historical data.
- **ETL & Data Engineering:** Automate data transformation and pipeline orchestration.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines:** Prepare and query massive datasets.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Collect, visualize, and analyze system performance metrics.

## **Scalability & Extensibility**
- Can be deployed **on-premise** or **in the cloud**.
- Supports **horizontal scaling** via Kubernetes.
- Modular architecture allows **plug-and-play integration** with additional services.

## **Conclusion**
This project serves as a **comprehensive, production-ready big data solution** that is **scalable, open-source, and extensible**. By leveraging distributed storage, federated querying, and robust monitoring, it enables efficient data analytics workflows for modern data-driven applications.
