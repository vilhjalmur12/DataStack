Great approach! Since we're building the **big data stack from the lowest data layer up**, let's establish a logical **bottom-up order** for setting up the services.

---

## **🔥 Suggested Order for Service Creation**
We will start from the **storage layer** (databases & data lake), then move up to **processing & querying**, and finally to **orchestration, monitoring, and logging**.

### **1️⃣ Core Databases & Storage Layer**
These form the foundation for structured and unstructured data storage.
- **MySQL** – Relational database for metadata storage.
- **PostgreSQL** – Alternative relational database (often used for transactional workloads).
- **Delta Lake** – Scalable, ACID-compliant data lake for raw data storage.

---

### **2️⃣ Data Warehousing & Real-Time Storage**
Once raw data storage is set up, we move to data warehousing and real-time analytics storage.
- **ClickHouse** – Columnar database optimized for high-speed analytics.
- **Apache Druid** – Real-time and historical OLAP database for large-scale event data.

---

### **3️⃣ Data Ingestion & ETL**
These services help move, transform, and load data into the storage systems.
- **Apache NiFi** – Low-code tool for real-time and batch data ingestion.
- **Apache Airflow** – Orchestration tool for managing ETL workflows.

---

### **4️⃣ Query Engine & Data Processing**
These tools enable efficient querying of stored data.
- **Presto & Trino** – Distributed SQL query engines for federated querying across multiple data sources.

---

### **5️⃣ Monitoring & Visualization**
Once data is flowing, we need monitoring and visualization tools.
- **Prometheus** – System metrics collection and alerting.
- **Grafana** – Dashboarding and visualization for monitoring.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – Centralized logging and search.

---

## **🚀 Final Execution Plan**
### **Phase 1: Core Databases**
✅ Set up **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Delta Lake**.

### **Phase 2: Data Warehousing**
✅ Configure **ClickHouse** and **Druid**.

### **Phase 3: Data Ingestion & Processing**
✅ Deploy **NiFi** and **Airflow** for managing ETL.

### **Phase 4: Query Engine**
✅ Set up **Presto & Trino** for querying.

### **Phase 5: Monitoring & Logging**
✅ Deploy **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **ELK Stack**.

Would you like to start with **MySQL** first, or do you have another preference? 🚀
